# NCWater_Utilities_Survey_Analysis
 
This is a survey data analysis project I completed during my role as a Data Research Assistant at the Environmental Finance Center at the University of North Carolina (UNC). As the primary analyst for this project, I was responsible for processing and analyzing comprehensive survey data from water utilities across North Carolina. The survey covered key topics such as financial management, infrastructure planning, regional collaboration, and environmental compliance. Using R, I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, generating a series of charts to present the survey results.

Specifically, I worked with survey data from nearly 400 water utilities in North Carolina, addressing critical areas such as organizational structure, rate setting, capital planning, PFAS treatment, and lead service line replacement. Through data analysis, I uncovered the primary challenges and emerging trends in financial management, infrastructure, and environmental compliance faced by water utilities in North Carolina. These findings provided valuable insights for policymakers and industry leaders. Due to confidentiality concerns, the specific data and code cannot be disclosed; however, I will present the key analysis results in an anonymized format.
